# Academic-Decathlon-Music-Theory-Practice
Practice the music questions commonly asked on the USAD Music Test involving theory.

Steps to get the code running:

1-consider using repl.it for an online Python compiler. 

2-create a Python file and copy and paste the code shown in the source file

**for any Python coders reading this:

to make a question, whether it be chord, interval, or scale, all you must do is call the object created.

ex. to make a chord question --> chord()

moreover, feel free to edit the driver code to customize to whatever question you wish to practice.

**future edits of the program will be coming. They will make all keyboard keys based off integers.
